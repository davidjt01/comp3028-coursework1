# Wikipedia frequency tables

This folder contains **letter frequency**, **bigram**, and **trigram** data (as JSON) used by Task 1. The data can be generated by the project script that fetches tables from Wikipedia.

## Setup (use virtual environment)

From the **project root**:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Generating the JSON files

Run from the **project root** (the script lives under `scripts/` and writes output here):

```powershell
python scripts/fetch_wikipedia_frequencies.py
```

Or with the venv activated: `python scripts/fetch_wikipedia_frequencies.py`

Output is written to this folder (`data/frequencies/`).

## Output files

| File | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `letter_frequency.json` | [Letter frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency) | 26 letters with `texts_percent` (and `dictionaries_percent` when present in the table) |
| `bigram_frequency.json` | [Bigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram) | Letter bigrams with `frequency_percent` |
| `trigram_frequency.json` | [Trigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram) | 16 common trigrams with `rank` and `frequency_percent` |

## Verification

- **Letter**: E ≈ 12.7%, T ≈ 9.1%, A ≈ 8.2% (matches Wikipedia "texts" column).
- **Bigram**: th ≈ 3.56%, he ≈ 3.07%, in ≈ 2.43%.
- **Trigram**: the ≈ 1.81%, and ≈ 0.73%, ing ≈ 0.72%.
