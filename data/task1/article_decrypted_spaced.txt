the enigma machine was invented by the german engineer arthur scherbius at the
end of world war i [] this was not known until when a paper by karl de
leeuw was found that described in detail arthur scherbius changes [] the
german firm scherbius ritter co founded by arthur scherbius patented ideas
for a cipher machine in and began marketing the finished product under
the brand name enigma in initially targeted at commercial markets []
early models were used commercially from the early s and adopted by
military and government services of several countries most notably nazi
germany before and during world war ii

several different enigma models were produced but the german military models
having a plugboard were the most complex japanese and italian models were
also in use with its adoption in slightly modified form by the german navy
in and the german army and air force soon after the name enigma became
widely known in military circles pre war german military planning emphasized
fast mobile forces and tactics later known as blitzkrieg which depend on
radio communication for command and coordination since adversaries would
likely intercept radio signals messages would have to be protected with
secure encoding compact and easily portable the enigma machine filled that
need

like other rotor machines the enigma machine is a combination of mechanical
and electrical subsystems the mechanical subsystem consists of a keyboard a
set of rotating disks called rotors arranged adjacently along a spindle one
of various stepping components to turn at least one rotor with each key press
and a series of lamps one for each letter these design features are the
reason that the enigma machine was originally referred to as the rotor based
cipher machine during its intellectual inception in
